# NY Citibike Challenge

## Overview
Using data collected from the Citi Bike ridership in New York City, the goal is to create visualizations in Tableau to identify trends that will inform a proposal to launch a bike sharing service in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results
In order to visualize rider data by time of day, the original data file was cleaned using Pandas to convert the integer data type for Trip Duration into an hour of the day.
